## Circle([Dot](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Dot.md) center, double radius)

# Methods

## Contains([Circle](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Circle.md) b)

**bool**  

This circle entirely contains circle B, or they exactly overlap.  

## Contains([Wedge](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Wedge.md) b)

**bool**  

This circle entirely contains wedge B.  

## Contains([Dot](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Dot.md) b)

**bool**  

Point B lies within or on this circle.  

## ContainsOrIsContained([Circle](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Circle.md) b)

**bool**  

This circle entirely contains circle B, or B entirely contains this circle, or they exactly overlap.  

## DegreesAtPoint([Dot](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Dot.md) lineEnd)

**double**  

Given a line from the center of a circle to a point, what degrees is the line angle at? 0 degrees is East from center, and increases clockwise.  

## Equals(object b)

**virtual bool**  

## GetHashCode()

**virtual int**  

## GetIntersectionPoints([Circle](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Circle.md) b)

**[Dot[]](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Dot.md)**  

**Returns:**  
Null (no intersection), an array of length 1, or an array of length 2.  

## GetIntersectionPoints([Line](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Line.md) line)

**[Dot[]](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Dot.md)**  

**Returns:**  
Null (no intercepts), or array of length 1 or 2.  

## GetIntersectionPoints([LineSegment](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.LineSegment.md) lineSegment)

**[Dot[]](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Dot.md)**  

**Returns:**  
Null (no intercepts), or array of length 1 or 2.  

## GetTangentPoints([Dot](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Dot.md) b)

**[Dot[]](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Dot.md)**  

Find the two tangent points on the circle that form lines to point B.  

**Returns:**  
Array of 2 Points.  

## Overlaps([Circle](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Circle.md) b)

**bool**  

Any part of this circle overlaps any part of circle B.  

## Overlaps([LineSegment](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.LineSegment.md) b)

**bool**  

Any part of this circle overlaps any part of line segment B.  

If line B lies within the circle, that counts as overlapping.
