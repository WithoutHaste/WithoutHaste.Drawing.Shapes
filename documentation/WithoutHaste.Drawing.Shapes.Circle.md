# Methods

## Contains([Circle](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Circle.md) b)

**bool**  

Returns true if this circle entirely contains circle _b_, or they exactly overlap.  

## Contains([Wedge](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Wedge.md) b)

**bool**  

Returns true if this circle entirely contains wedge _b_.  

## Contains([Dot](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Dot.md) b)

**bool**  

Returns true if point _b_ lies within or on this circle.  

## ContainsOrIsContained([Circle](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Circle.md) b)

**bool**  

Returns true if this circle entirely contains circle _b_, or _b_ entirely contains this circle, or they exactly overlap.  

## DegreesAtPoint([Dot](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Dot.md) lineEnd)

**double**  

Given a line from the center of this circle to a point (_lineEnd_), what degrees is the line angle at?   
0 degrees is East of center, increases clockwise.  

## Equals(object b)

**virtual bool**  

Circle centers and radiuses are the same.  

## GetHashCode()

**virtual int**  

## GetIntersectionPoints([Circle](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Circle.md) b)

**[Dot[]](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Dot.md)**  

Finds the intersection points between the edge of this circle and circle _b_.  

**Returns:**  
Null (no intersection), an array of length 1, or an array of length 2.  

## GetIntersectionPoints([Line](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Line.md) line)

**[Dot[]](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Dot.md)**  

**Returns:**  
Null (no intercepts), or array of length 1 or 2.  

## GetIntersectionPoints([LineSegment](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.LineSegment.md) lineSegment)

**[Dot[]](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Dot.md)**  

Find the intersection points between the edge of this circle and the _lineSegment_.  

**Returns:**  
Null (no intercepts), or array of length 1, or array of length 2.  

## GetTangentPoints([Dot](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Dot.md) b)

**[Dot[]](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Dot.md)**  

Find the two tangent points on the circle that form lines to point _b_.  

**Returns:**  
Array of length 2.  

## Overlaps([Circle](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Circle.md) b)

**bool**  

Returns true if any part of this circle overlaps any part of circle _b_.  

## Overlaps([LineSegment](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.LineSegment.md) b)

**bool**  

Returns true if any part of this circle overlaps any part of line segment _b_.  

**Remarks:**  
If line _b_ lies within the circle, that counts as overlapping.  

## Paint([System.Drawing.Graphics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.graphics) graphics, [System.Drawing.Pen](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.pen) pen, double unitsToPixels)

**void**  

Draw the figure on the _graphics_ with the _pen_.  

**Parameters:**  
* **double unitsToPixels**: Conversion ratio from figure units to pixels. A value of "2" means all figure measurements will be doubled.  

## PointAtDegrees(double degrees)

**[Dot](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Dot.md)**  

Returns the point on this circle at the _degrees_ measurement.   
0 degrees is East of center, increases clockwise.  

## PointAtRadians(double radians)

**[Dot](WithoutHaste.Drawing.Shapes.Dot.md)**  

Returns the point on this circle at the _radians_ measurement.   
0 radians is East of center, increases clockwise.  

## ToString()

**virtual string**  

Format "C:(x,y) R:radius"  

# Static Methods

## DegreesToRadians(double degrees)

**static double**  

Convert degrees to radians.  

## RadiansToDegrees(double radians)

**static double**  

Convert radians to degrees.  

# Operators

## Circle = Circle a / double b

Scale circle down by _b_ amount. Affects length and location measures.  

**Example A:**  
`circle / 2` returns a new Circle with half the radius and half the distance from point (0,0).  

## bool = Circle a == Circle b

Circle centers and radiuses are the same.  

## bool = Circle a != Circle b

Circle centers or radiuses are different.
